/**
 * RRule schedule, based on the iCalendar standard
([RFC 5545](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5545)) as
implemented in `dateutils.rrule`.

RRules are appropriate for any kind of calendar-date manipulation, including
irregular intervals, repetition, exclusions, week day or day-of-month
adjustments, and more.

Note that as a calendar-oriented standard, `RRuleSchedules` are sensitive to
to the initial timezone provided. A 9am daily schedule with a daylight saving
time-aware start date will maintain a local 9am time through DST boundaries;
a 9am daily schedule with a UTC start date will maintain a 9am UTC time.

Args:
    rrule (str): a valid RRule string
    timezone (str, optional): a valid timezone string
