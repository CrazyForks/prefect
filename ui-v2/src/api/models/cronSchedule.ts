/**
 * Cron schedule

NOTE: If the timezone is a DST-observing one, then the schedule will adjust
itself appropriately. Cron's rules for DST are based on schedule times, not
intervals. This means that an hourly cron schedule will fire on every new
schedule hour, not every elapsed hour; for example, when clocks are set back
this will result in a two-hour pause as the schedule will fire *the first
time* 1am is reached and *the first time* 2am is reached, 120 minutes later.
Longer schedules, such as one that fires at 9am every morning, will
automatically adjust for DST.

Args:
    cron (str): a valid cron string
    timezone (str): a valid timezone string in IANA tzdata format (for example,
        America/New_York).
    day_or (bool, optional): Control how croniter handles `day` and `day_of_week`
        entries. Defaults to True, matching cron which connects those values using
        OR. If the switch is set to False, the values are connected using AND. This
        behaves like fcron and enables you to e.g. define a job that executes each
        2nd friday of a month by setting the days of month and the weekday.
