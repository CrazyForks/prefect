description: Use branch-based deployments to do CI/CD with your Prefect flows.

When you make a change to a flow, you should test the change before promoting it to production.
In this tutorial, you'll use branch-based deployments in Prefect Cloud to test a GitHub PR.

## Prerequisites

- A Prefect Cloud account
- Fork the demo repository to an org where you have admin access

## Install the GitHub App

- Install the Prefect GitHub App from the GitHub Marketplace

## Install the GitHub Action

- Generate Prefect secrets
- Set the secrets on the GitHub repository
- Install the GitHub Action
- Pass the secrets to the GitHub Action as environment variables

## Propose changes to a flow

- Clone your fork of the demo repository
- Create a new branch
- Make a change to the flow and commit it to the branch
- Push the branch to GitHub
- Create a PR

## Test your changes

- Click **View deployment** to open the deployment for this branch in Prefect
- Perform a test run of the deployment
- Wait for the run to finish
- Go back to the PR and confirm that the deployment succeeded

## Merge your changes

- Click **Merge PR**
- Go back to Prefect Cloud and confirm that a new deployment version was created

NOTE: The ephemeral deployment was deleted when the PR was merged

## Make your changes live

- In Prefect Cloud, go to the deployment and set the latest version as active.
- Run the deployment (this will automatically run the active version)

Once the deployment is complete, your changes are effectively live.
Now you know how to promote changes to production with Prefect Cloud.
